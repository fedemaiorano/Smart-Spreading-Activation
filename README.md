A smart Spreading Activation algorithm written in `Prolog` for networks analysis. 

Project's files:

  * *Spreading activation intelligente - Progetto IA Maiorano.pdf* is the project's documentation written in italian;
  * *spreadingINT.pl* is the `Prolog` script of the smart spreading activation algorithm;
  * *spreadingTRAD.pl* is the `Prolog` script of a traditional spreading activation algorithm;
  * *spreadingNeo4j.txt* is the list of `Neo4j` queries to execute a spreading activation algorithm.
